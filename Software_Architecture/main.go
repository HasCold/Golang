// Yes, you're correct in how you've categorized the terms:

// ### Software Design Patterns:
// - **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: A design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: the Model (data), the View (UI), and the Controller (business logic). It's commonly used in web applications.
// - **Event-Driven Architecture**: A design pattern in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs or threads.

// ### Software Architecture:
// - **Monolith**: A software architecture pattern where all components of an application are tightly integrated and run as a single unit or application. Changes to the system often require redeploying the entire application.
// - **Microservices**: A software architecture pattern where the application is divided into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

// So, your distinction between software design patterns and software architecture is accurate. Design patterns like MVC and event-driven architecture are used to structure code within a particular component or system, while architectures like Monolith and Microservices describe how the entire application is structured and organized.

// -------------------------------- COnvert Monolith App to Microservices App ----------------------------------

// The **Strangler Fig** pattern is commonly used by mature companies to gradually refactor and transform their monolithic applications into microservices.

// ### Strangler Fig Pattern:
// - **Concept**: The pattern is inspired by the strangler fig tree, which grows around an existing tree and eventually replaces it. Similarly, in software, you incrementally replace parts of a monolithic system with new microservices until the monolith is fully decomposed.

// - **How It Works**:
//   1. **Identify a Component or Functionality**: Start by identifying a part of the monolith that can be extracted into a microservice.
//   2. **Create a Microservice**: Develop the new functionality as a microservice, separate from the monolith.
//   3. **Redirect Traffic**: Gradually route traffic from the monolithic component to the new microservice. This can be done through API gateways, proxies, or other routing mechanisms.
//   4. **Iterate**: Repeat this process for other components until the entire monolithic application has been broken down into microservices.

// - **Benefits**:
//   - **Incremental Migration**: You can incrementally refactor and replace parts of the monolith without having to rebuild the entire system from scratch.
//   - **Reduced Risk**: By migrating gradually, you reduce the risk of introducing errors or downtime, as each component is handled independently.
//   - **Immediate Value**: The organization can start benefiting from the advantages of microservices (scalability, flexibility, etc.) early in the migration process.

// ### Real-World Usage:
// - **Netflix**: Netflix is a well-known example of a company that used the Strangler Fig pattern to migrate from a monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture. They started by creating microservices for certain functionalities and gradually decomposed their entire monolithic application.
// - **Amazon**: Amazon also migrated from a monolithic architecture to microservices using a similar approach, allowing them to scale and innovate more efficiently.

// By using the Strangler Fig pattern, mature companies can manage the complexity of transitioning to microservices while maintaining the stability and performance of their existing systems.
