Sure! Let's break it down simply:

### **Deadlock**
- **What is it?**  
  A deadlock happens when two or more goroutines (lightweight threads in Go) are stuck waiting for each other to release resources, and none of them can proceed. It's like two people trying to pass through a narrow door at the same time, but neither of them moves aside.

- **Example in Go:**  
  Deadlocks can occur with channels or mutexes when goroutines are waiting forever.  
  ```go
  package main

  import "sync"

  func main() {
      var mu sync.Mutex

      mu.Lock()
      // Trying to lock the same mutex again without unlocking creates a deadlock
      mu.Lock()
  }
  ```
  In this case, the second `mu.Lock()` call will wait forever because the first lock hasn't been released.

### **Race Condition**
- **What is it?**  
  A race condition happens when two or more goroutines access the same data at the same time, and at least one of them modifies the data. The program's behavior becomes unpredictable because the outcome depends on the timing of the goroutines.

- **Example in Go:**  
  ```go
  package main

  import (
      "fmt"
      "sync"
  )

  func main() {
      var counter int
      var wg sync.WaitGroup

      for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
          wg.Add(1)
          go func() {
              counter++ // Multiple goroutines modifying 'counter' at the same time
              wg.Done()
          }()
      }

      wg.Wait()
      fmt.Println("Counter:", counter) // This may not print 1000 every time
  }
  ```
  Here, multiple goroutines increment the `counter` without coordination, leading to unpredictable results.

### **How to Avoid Them**
1. **Avoid Deadlocks:**
   - Always unlock a `Mutex` after locking it (use `defer` to ensure it happens).
   - Make sure goroutines using channels follow the proper send-receive pattern.

   Example:
   ```go
   mu.Lock()
   defer mu.Unlock() // Ensures unlock even if a panic occurs
   ```

2. **Avoid Race Conditions:**
   - Use synchronization mechanisms like `sync.Mutex` or `sync/Atomic` to coordinate goroutines.
   - Run your program with the `-race` flag to detect race conditions during execution:
     ```bash
     go run -race main.go
     ```
   - Example fix:
     ```go
     var mu sync.Mutex
     mu.Lock()
     counter++ // Safe because of the mutex
     mu.Unlock()
     ```
