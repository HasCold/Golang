// ------------------------------------- Explanation Of connectDB function ------------------------------------

// 1. Context Creation: You create a context with a timeout of 10 seconds. This context will automatically cancel if the operation takes too long, preventing hanging operations.

// 2. MongoDB Connection: mongo.Connect establishes a connection to MongoDB using the provided URI.

// 3. Ping MongoDB: You use client.Ping to verify that the connection to MongoDB is successful.

// 4. Assign to Global Manager: You store the client and context in the Mgr global variable.

//
// ------------------------------------- Explanation Of Close function ------------------------------------

// - This function is responsible for properly closing the MongoDB connection and canceling the context when you are done with the database. It ensures that resources are cleaned up.

// Error Handling:
// The if err := client.Disconnect(ctx); err != nil { ... } part checks if an error occurred during the disconnection.
// If an error does occur (e.g., if the disconnection fails), the panic(err) line is executed. panic will stop the normal execution of the program and print the error, which is useful for debugging critical issues that should not be ignored.

// - Resource Cleanup: This code ensures that the MongoDB client is always disconnected when the surrounding function (Close) finishes, regardless of whether the function exits normally or due to an error. This is essential for freeing up resources and preventing memory leaks or open connections that could exhaust the database connection pool.

// - Panic on Error: The panic(err) part indicates that if something goes wrong during disconnection, itâ€™s considered a serious problem, and the program should not continue running. This is often used during development to catch unexpected issues.
