Understanding Interfaces in Go
In Go, an interface is a type that specifies a set of method signatures. When a type implements all the methods in an interface, values of that type can be assigned to a variable of the interface type.

Example in Your Code

Interface Declaration:
type Manager interface {
    Insert(interface{}) error
    GetAll() ([]User, error)
    DeleteData(primitive.ObjectID) error
    UpdateData(User) error
}

Struct Declaration:
type manager struct {
    Connection *mongo.Client
    Ctx        context.Context
    Cancel     context.CancelFunc
}

Variable Declaration
When you declare var Mgr Manager, you are declaring a variable Mgr of type Manager, which is an interface.
var Mgr Manager

Assigning a Struct Pointer to an Interface Variable
The line where you assign &manager{...} to Mgr works because the Go language allows a pointer to a struct to be assigned to an interface variable, provided that the struct (or its pointer) implements all the methods in the interface.

Assignment:
Mgr = &manager{Connection: client, Ctx: ctx, Cancel: cancel}

Here’s how this works:

Pointer to Struct (&manager): The expression &manager{...} creates a pointer to a manager struct.
1. Interface Satisfaction: The *manager type (a pointer to the manager struct) implements the Manager interface because it has all the methods required by the Manager interface (Insert, GetAll, DeleteData, UpdateData).

2. Dynamic Typing in Interfaces: In Go, an interface can hold any type that implements the interface's methods. When you assign &manager{...} to Mgr, the Mgr variable now holds a reference to the manager struct, but it is treated as the Manager interface type.


What’s Happening Behind the Scenes?
When you assign &manager{...} to Mgr, two things happen:

1. Concrete Type Storage: The Mgr interface variable stores:
. The concrete value, which is the pointer to the manager struct.
. The concrete type, which is *manager.

2. Method Calls via Interface: When you call methods on Mgr, Go uses the stored type information to call the correct methods on the underlying *manager value. The interface allows you to interact with the value via the methods defined in the Manager interface, without needing to know the underlying type.


Example to Clarify
Consider the following:

var Mgr Manager        // Mgr is a variable of type Manager (interface)
Mgr = &manager{...}    // &manager{...} is of type *manager, which implements Manager

// Now you can call methods defined in the Manager interface on Mgr:
Mgr.Insert(someData)
Mgr is of type Manager (interface).
&manager{...} is of type *manager, which implements the Manager interface.

Since *manager implements Manager, assigning &manager{...} to Mgr is allowed, and Mgr can now be used to call any method specified in the Manager interface.

Summary :-
. Interfaces in Go are satisfied by any type that implements all of the methods in the interface.
. When you assign &manager{...} to Mgr, you are assigning a pointer to a struct (*manager) that implements the Manager interface.
. Mgr can now be used to call the methods defined in the Manager interface, regardless of the underlying type.
. This is a powerful feature in Go that allows for flexible and decoupled code, where functions can operate on any type that satisfies a particular interface, without being tightly bound to a specific concrete type.


---------------------------------- Empty Interface Method --------------------------------------

This is a great question! It touches on a key concept in Go related to how interfaces work, particularly the `interface{}` type, which is known as the *empty interface*.

### The Empty Interface: `interface{}`

In Go, `interface{}` is a special type that can hold any value. This is because every type in Go implements at least the empty interface. So, when you see a function that accepts a parameter of type `interface{}`, it means that the function can accept any type of value—whether it's an integer, a string, a struct, a slice, or anything else.

### How This Works in Your Code

Let’s break down what’s happening step by step.

1. **Struct Instance**:
   ```go
   u := User{Name: "go Hasan", Email: "ha029292@gmail.com"}
   ```
   - Here, you’re creating an instance of the `User` struct. The type of `u` is `User`.

2. **Method Call**:
   ```go
   err := Mgr.Insert(u)
   ```
   - You’re passing the `u` variable, which is of type `User`, to the `Insert` method of `Mgr` (which is of type `Manager` interface). 
   - The `Insert` method has the following signature:
     ```go
     func (mgr *manager) Insert(data interface{}) error
     ```
   - Notice that the `Insert` method accepts a parameter of type `interface{}`.

3. **Passing `User` Struct to `interface{}`**:
   - The `data` parameter in `Insert` is of type `interface{}`. 
   - When you pass `u`, which is of type `User`, to this method, Go automatically wraps the `User` struct in an `interface{}` type.
   - The `interface{}` type is like a container that can hold any value, regardless of its type.

4. **Type Assertion or Reflection**:
   - Inside the `Insert` method, `data` is treated as an `interface{}`. If you need to access the underlying value (the `User` struct in this case), you can use a **type assertion** or **type switch**.
   - Example of type assertion:
     ```go
     user := data.(User)  // Extract the User struct from the interface{}
     ```
   - If you try to assert the wrong type, Go will panic. To avoid this, you can do a safe type assertion:
     ```go
     user, ok := data.(User)
     if !ok {
         return errors.New("data is not of type User")
     }
     ```

### Why There’s No Type Mismatch

There’s no type mismatch because of how Go’s type system and interfaces work:

- **`interface{}` is a universal container**: It can hold any type, so when you pass `u`, which is of type `User`, to the `Insert` method, it’s accepted because `interface{}` can store any value.

- **Dynamic Typing at Runtime**: The actual type (`User`) is stored alongside the value inside the `interface{}`. The method can later retrieve this type information if needed.

### Summary

- **`interface{}`** in Go can hold any value, so it can accept variables of any type.
- When you pass `u` of type `User` to `Mgr.Insert(u)`, the `User` value is stored inside the `interface{}`.
- Inside the `Insert` method, you can use type assertions or reflection to retrieve and work with the original `User` value.

This feature of Go makes interfaces very powerful and flexible, enabling functions to handle a wide variety of types in a type-safe manner.
